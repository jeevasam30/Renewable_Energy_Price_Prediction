# Renewable Energy Market Predictions of Germany, India, and Norway
#Overview <br/>
It mainly focuses on the comparison of the energy markets of Germany, Norway, and India.The two main sources of renewable energy were considered: solar and wind.
Germany and Norway, as Norway contributes most to renewable energy, especially solar, in the European Union. and India was compared as a country near the equator and how expensive it is to produce renewable energy.
All prices are converted to the base price in euros.<br/>
**Update:** The project has been enhanced with forecasting models, particularly ARIMA.<br/>
